            One of the most common activities to do at Palawan is island
            hopping. You typically hop on boats like the ones I pictured myself
            above and they can take you to various islands from 5-7 islands,
            some can be customized, you can either book an entire boat to
            yourself and your group or be with outher tourists.

            Another exciting activity is Kayaking. They typically have the
            kayaks on this floating store which is basically a boat and they
            rent it to you. They have designated areas where you can kayak to
            preserve the ocean environment.

            In the picture above, I teamed up with my godbrother as we kayaked
            to the big and small lagoons. We regret not taking pictures because
            the views were breathtaking. We were even told that a small area in
            the small lagoon, there lived baby sharks which was pretty insane
            knowing how close we were.

            I personally don't do it often here in LA but hiking there was
            magnificent. I personally got the opportunity to see such an amazing
            view such as the image I took of above. Me and my godfamily decided
            to do a morning hike to get us to wake up a little before another
            day of adventure.

            This HAS to be my favorite activity in the entire trip: snorkling!!
            At first it was scary because I'm in the middle of the open ocean
            but once I dove into the water, I was just amazed at what I saw.
            I've never been so close to a school of fishes, coral reefs that are
            vibrant in color, and just being at the center of it all was
            unbelievable! I looked around it was just a whole other world
            because the sea seemed endless from that one point I was floating
            from.
