          There are multiple ways to get to El Nido and the fastest yet most
          expensive way is going straight from Manile to El Nido. according to a
          travel website called
          <a
            href="https://www.elnidoparadise.com/how-to-get-to-el-nido-palawan/"
            >El Nido Paradise</a
          >

          mentioned that an airline company called Air Swift have multiple
          flights to El Nido but it ranges from 7,000-9,000 pesos(approx.
          $140-$180) per person depending on the season and if they have any
          special offers.

          Another common way, and one of the cheapest way, is a flight to their
          local airport in the city of Puerto Princessa. We took this route for
          our trip since it was cheaper even though it was the one of the longer
          route. It was an additional 6 hours on the road but we did stop over a
          lot of popular spots like Baker's Hill where they have amazing baked
          goods and a lot of the small shops have an overloooking view of the
          ocean.

        <p>
          Another way is getting there by sea. According to
          <a
            href="https://www.elnidoparadise.com/how-to-get-to-el-nido-palawan/"
            >El Nido Paradise</a
          >
          you are able to buy a ticket for Manila to Coron and then purchase a
          second ticket from Coron to Palawan so it can take up to 24 hours by
          sea to get to El Nido. This would be the longest option by far and
          quite expensive as well.
